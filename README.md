Run Features_Speedtest.py
* https://github.com/TechnoTanuki/Python_BMP/blob/main/Features_Speedtest.py
* It should generate a bitmap and open MS Paint under windows to show output... 
Close the MS Paint window to execute another script

# Unit tests

https://github.com/TechnoTanuki/Python_BMP/blob/main/test_picturemanipulation.py
